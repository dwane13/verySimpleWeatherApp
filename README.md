# verySimpleWeatherApp
Training app where im tryind to understand compose+clean

Compose + MVVM + Clean, Retrofit for networking, Navigation for ..., Hilt for DI, Flow for fun (they are awesome, actually), and Kotlin for inner piece and harmony.

For this application to work you need to get yourself an API token from https://openweathermap.org/api (its free)
Then just create file apikey.properties in your project root and a constant in there -> 'WEATHER_API="$YOUR_API_KEY"'.

Launch!
