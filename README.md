# verySimpleWeatherApp
Compose + MVVM + Clean, Retrofit for networking, Navigation for ..., Hilt for DI, Flow for fun (they are awesome, actually), and Kotlin for inner piece and harmony.

For this application to work you need to get yourself an API token from https://openweathermap.org/api (its free)
Then just create file apikey.properties in your project root and a constant in there -> 'WEATHER_API="$YOUR_API_KEY"'.

Launch!

p.s. Make sure to checkout compose branch! 
Its currently under development but there are my most recent knowledges (compose and Clean still under my active learning, so im open your advices and feedback)
